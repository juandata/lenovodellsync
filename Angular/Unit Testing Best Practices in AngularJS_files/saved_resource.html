Isn't this good practise for unit tests too?  I find the main reason unit test suites aren't written or maintained is because they break when the code changes.</p><p>If you consider a unit as a discrete piece of functionality rather than one method then you don't have to refactor your tests along with the code and you can still prove behaviour.</p><p>I see so much written about unit testing that dependencies were injected or method calls were expected but this makes unit tests brittle, I can't help thinking we're restricting our code with tests like that.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

So, kind of off topic but suppose that you are using only jquery for a heavy DOM manipulating cross browser widget app and you want to unit test it. Would you access directly to DOM in your unit tests? Or mock DOM or separate the logic for unit tests and cover DOM integrating points with integration/e2e tests? Thanks.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

the tests you must load them with 'angular.mock.module('yourApp');' This is also exposed as a global so, 'module('yourApp');' is exactly the same as 'angular.mock.module('yourApp');'. You would never use angular.module('yourApp');. As Andy says, karma.conf.js contains the reference to the file that contains the module (which in most cases is the actual module your are trying to test).</p><p>If, in your modules, there are calls to other services or functions that you don't want to test you would create a 'mock' of the service or function. This allows the test system to bypass the call in your module and replace it with the mock version you have defined.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

custom mocked version of the App module. You may require dumbed down behaviour from this module, or you may just want to load the real thing, in which case this call can just simply point to your real module.</p><p>If you check out the answer on this post, you can see then you can store custom mock versions of modules in a separate folder, which are loaded in the config of your integration test tool (e.g. Karma.conf.js).<br><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F17554727%2Fmocking-angular-module-dependencies-in-jasmine-unit-tests%3AHhUWA4f5bIED8Vw-iMw_fcyNVJA&amp;cuid=1185559" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17554727/mocking-angular-module-dependencies-in-jasmine-unit-tests">http://stackoverflow.com/qu...</a></p><p>In that example, the mocked module simply references the real module. Even if this is the case, I'd say it's good practice to create mock versions of modules like this in case you want to quickly mock some behaviour that's interfering with your tests.</p><p>For example, if your 'App' module loads a service called TwitterService which sends http requests to get your last 10 tweets form the Twitter API, you may decide to create a mocked version of the App module which loads a mock version of the TwitterService instead, which simply returns some static JSON.</p><p>The tests that you're writing which contain this call to angular.mock.module('App') may not be aware of the TwitterService, as it's injected into the App module, but the http request that the TwitterService will send may interfere with your tests. We should therefore configure the App module to suppress this external request for tweets, as this functionality is not important for these particular tests (and should have its own tests elsewhere anyway).</p><p>TL;DR: It's a good way of configuring modules to run in a test environment, so you can nullify underlying behaviour which may interfere with your tests.</p></div></div><span
